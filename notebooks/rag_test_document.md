# NVIDIA RAG Test Document

## Introduction
This is a comprehensive test document for the NVIDIA RAG Blueprint system. It contains various facts and information designed to test the retrieval and generation capabilities.

## Test Facts

### Geography
- The capital of France is Paris, known for the Eiffel Tower and rich cultural heritage
- Tokyo is the capital of Japan and one of the world's most populous metropolitan areas
- London is the capital of the United Kingdom, located on the River Thames
- New York City is the largest city in the United States by population

### Technology
- Python is a high-level programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991
- JavaScript is the programming language of the web, enabling interactive websites
- Docker containers provide isolated environments for running applications consistently
- Kubernetes orchestrates containerized applications across clusters of machines
- Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code

### Artificial Intelligence
- Machine learning models can process natural language and understand context
- The NVIDIA embedding model produces 2048-dimensional vectors for text representation
- The RTX 5070 Ti is a powerful GPU designed for AI workloads and gaming
- The RTX 4060 is a consumer GPU suitable for moderate AI tasks
- RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation, combining search with AI generation
- Vector embeddings enable semantic search and similarity matching
- Transformer models revolutionized natural language processing since 2017
- BERT and GPT are popular transformer-based architectures
- Milvus is a vector database optimized for storing and searching embeddings

### Computing Concepts
- CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, the brain of the computer
- GPU stands for Graphics Processing Unit, optimized for parallel processing
- RAM provides fast temporary storage for active programs and data
- SSD offers faster storage than traditional hard disk drives
- VRAM is dedicated memory on graphics cards for visual processing
- CUDA enables parallel computing acceleration on NVIDIA GPUs

### Cloud Computing
- Cloud NIMs provide AI models as a service without local hardware requirements
- API endpoints allow remote access to computational resources
- Latency is the delay between request and response in network communications
- Throughput measures the amount of data processed per unit time

## System Architecture
The NVIDIA RAG Blueprint uses a microservices architecture with:
- Ingestion service for document processing
- Embedding service for vector generation
- Vector database for similarity search
- LLM service for response generation
- Reranking service for result optimization

## Performance Metrics
- Default chunk size: 512 tokens
- Chunk overlap: 150 tokens  
- Embedding dimensions: 2048
- Processing time: varies with cloud API response

This document tests the complete RAG pipeline from ingestion to query response.
